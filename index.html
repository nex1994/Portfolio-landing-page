            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jakub, and at 29 years old, I've been passionately pursuing coding for the past six months. My primary objective is to establish a career as a web developer, not only for the stability it offers but also for the freedom it provides to work from any corner of the globe and specialize in any area I choose.
